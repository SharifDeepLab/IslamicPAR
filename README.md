# IslamicPAR
## Project Overview
This project focuses on Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR), an important yet challenging task that plays a key role in Pedestrian Re-Identification (ReID) and Person Retrieval. We present a novel real-world dataset named **IslaminPAR** tailored to PAR's unique challenges in diverse environments and cultural contexts. We also fine-tune the C2T-Net model with some improvements to the dataset. We tackle challenges like:

1. **Cultural Adaptation**: Our dataset is specifically designed to reflect Islamic cultural norms, providing a unique contribution to the PAR community. This dataset includes a wide variety of clothing styles, such as Hijab models, and formal and informal wear for male and female pedestrians.
2. **Environmental & Scene Diversity**: To support robust model generalization, the dataset includes:
    - A range of illumination conditions (day/night, varying shadows)
    - Weather variations, including rainy conditions
    - Realistic challenges such as:
      - Occluded pedestrians
      - Multiple people per box
      - Partial body visibility
